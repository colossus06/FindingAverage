# FindingAverage
-Here's how you can find the average of a set of numbers. Find the sum of the numbers Divide the sum by the number of addends.
- `value` is the **iteration variable**
- run the loop for `[ 5,4,3,2,1]` 5 times
- and we divide the average `sum` over `count`
- print the result with converting to `int` with `int()` function
